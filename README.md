# Refactored-Prime-And-Composite-Number-Generator
While I enjoy Math, I'm not sold Math always enjoys me. To diminish my human error, I made a number generator from 1-50 that identifies if a number is prime or composite. Since I love public feedback, you can customize if #1 is displayed as a prime, composite, or neither number by answering the brief survey and clicking submit. You can update your answer and click submit again to update the list accordingly. Thanks!
